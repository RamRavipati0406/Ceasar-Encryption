# Ceasar-Encryption
A "rot cipher" is a type of simple substitution cipher, also known as a Caesar cipher. It is a method of encrypting a message by shifting each letter of the plaintext a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. The term "rot" stands for "rotate," as you are essentially rotating the letters of the alphabet.

Here's how a basic rot cipher works:

1. Choose a fixed number, known as the "key" or "shift value." This key determines how much each letter in the plaintext should be shifted.

2. Assign a numerical value to each letter of the alphabet (e.g., A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25).

3. To encrypt a message, replace each letter in the plaintext with the letter that is located a certain number of positions down the alphabet. If you reach the end of the alphabet, wrap around to the beginning.

4. To decrypt a message, reverse the process by shifting each letter in the ciphertext in the opposite direction of the original shift.
